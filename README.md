# warthog-starter

This is a minimal example of using the [Warthog](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog) GraphQL API library.

## Setup

To get things set up, start postgres with `yarn postgres:start`, then `yarn bootstrap` in another tab.

## Running the server

Start postgres with `yarn postgres:start`, then `yarn start` to run the server.

## Using GraphQL Playground

When you run `yarn start`, it will open [graphql-playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).  When in the playground, you can issue queries and mutations against the API.  Try some of the examples in [examples.gql](./examples.gql).

## Running tests

Run `yarn test` to run tests
